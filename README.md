# Digit-Recognition-TensorFlow-Deep-Learning
Our problem is an image recognition, to identify digits from a given 28 x 28 image. Challenge can be found at https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-identify-the-digits/
We do not have any other feature only images in .png format that we ought to use in prediction.
We will be working with TensorFlow, therefore it is assumed that user had installed it https://www.tensorflow.org/install/.
